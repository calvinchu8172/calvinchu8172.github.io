In the beginning, I would like to establish an E-commerce website which is easily to deploy and scalable.
After researching **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, I think this way was **fulfilled my needs**.
However, after couple monthes we still thought AWS Elastic Beanstalk structure was **too expensive for us**, so the Wordpress website was **modified to a Linode server**.
