### CMI Production Flow

![CMI Factory Run]({% link /assets/hardware-work/cmi-factory-flow.png %})


1. KR(Kick-off Run)
  * Collabrate with display panel designer.
  * Survery **Display IC**.
  * Survey **FPC**.
  * **FPC circuit design**.
  * Survey passive components.
  * Manually assemble small quantity to test performance.
  * Start **programming the code** of **embedded system manufacture tools** for every station and optical engineers testing.
  * Program firmware into Display IC to adjust optical characteristics.
2. DR(Development Run)
  * Initail trial run in factory.
  * Display Panel bound with IC, FPC and passive components in Factory.
  * **Verify EE, ME, Optical and reliability performance**.
  * Improve the performance.
  * Improve the code of embedded system manufacture tools to shorten time.
  * **Solve Issues**.
  * **Bussiness trip to factory in China**.
3. SR(Sample Run)
  * Second trial run after modify design.
  * Verify EE, ME, Optical and reliability performance again.
  * Solve Issues if happens.
  * Bussiness trip to factory in China.
4. PR(Pilot Run)
  * The last trial run before MP.
  * Verify EE, ME, Optical and reliability performance again.
  * Should be no issues.
  * Bussiness trip to factory in China if need.
5. MP(Mass Production)
  * Celebrate!
